<h1>THE MUSTARD</h1>
<h2>Revolutionizing agriculture</h2>
 <p> "We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them"-Albert Einstein. 
   Agriculture has basically been the backbone of human civilizations. We need agriculture for food, and we need food to surive. 
   Though critically important, existing agricultural practices are slowly proving to be ineffective in terms of meeting the global needs for food security. 
   Rapid population growth, erratic weather patterns and poor agricultural habits are slowly turning previously agriculturally-productive lands to urban centers and desolate lands. 
   There's therefore urgent need to come up with novel ways of solving the existing agricultural crisis, in a sustainable way.
